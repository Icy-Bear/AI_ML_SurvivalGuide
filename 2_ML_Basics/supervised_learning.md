# Supervised Learning

## Definition

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data. The goal is to learn a mapping from input features to output labels based on examples provided during training.

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data:** The dataset used to train the model, containing input-output pairs.
- **Labels:** The output values or categories the model is learning to predict.
- **Model:** The algorithm or mathematical function that learns the mapping from inputs to outputs.
- **Loss Function:** A function that measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual labels. The model is optimized to minimize this loss.

## Types of Supervised Learning Problems

- **Classification:** Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam, disease or no disease).
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).

## Common Algorithms

- **Linear Regression**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Neural Networks**

## Applications

- **Email Filtering:** Classifying emails as spam or not spam.
- **Medical Diagnosis:** Predicting whether a patient has a certain disease.
- **Financial Forecasting:** Predicting stock prices or market trends.

## Example Code

See `supervised_learning.py` for an example implementation of a simple supervised learning algorithm.
