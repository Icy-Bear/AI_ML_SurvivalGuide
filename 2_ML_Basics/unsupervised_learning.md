# Unsupervised Learning

## Definition

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data that has no labels. The goal is to infer the natural structure present within a set of data points. Unlike supervised learning, there are no explicit target outputs; instead, the model tries to learn patterns and the underlying structure from the data itself.

## Key Concepts

- **Data:** The dataset used in unsupervised learning consists of only input features with no corresponding output labels.
- **Clustering:** Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Problems

- **Clustering:** The task of grouping a set of objects so that objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Examples include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM).
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) are used to reduce the number of features in the dataset while preserving the most important information.

## Common Algorithms

- **K-Means Clustering:** A simple and widely used clustering algorithm that partitions the dataset into K clusters by minimizing the variance within each cluster.
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** An algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters either in a bottom-up (agglomerative) or top-down (divisive) approach.
- **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** A probabilistic model that assumes the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variances lie on the first coordinates.
- **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE):** A technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets.

## Applications

- **Customer Segmentation:** Identifying distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior for targeted marketing.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detecting unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, commonly used in fraud detection and network security.
- **Image Compression:** Reducing the size of image files while preserving important information.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** Identifying sets of products frequently bought together to improve product placement and cross-selling strategies.
