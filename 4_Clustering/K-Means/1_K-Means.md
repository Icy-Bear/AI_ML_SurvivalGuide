# K-means Clustering

## Introduction

K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to partition a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping clusters. The goal is to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia), which measures the compactness of the clusters.

## Algorithm Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Randomly select K points from the data as initial centroids (using methods like k-means++ for better initialization).

2. **Assignment Step**:
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance.

3. **Update Step**:
   - Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all data points assigned to each cluster.

4. **Convergence Check**:
   - Repeat the assignment and update steps until the centroids no longer change significantly or a predefined number of iterations is reached.

## Distance Metric

- **Euclidean Distance**: Commonly used metric to measure the distance between data points and centroids.

## Choosing the Number of Clusters (K)

- **Elbow Method**: Plot the within-cluster sum of squares against the number of clusters and look for the "elbow" point where the rate of decrease slows down.
- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters.

## Practical Applications

### Customer Segmentation

K-means clustering is widely used in customer segmentation to group customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction.

### Image Compression

In image processing, K-means clustering can be used for image compression by reducing the number of colors in an image. Each pixel is assigned to the nearest cluster centroid, representing a color in the compressed image.

### Anomaly Detection

K-means can also be used for anomaly detection by identifying data points that do not belong to any cluster or belong to clusters with very few data points.

## Combining K-means with PCA

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining most of the variance. This can make the clustering process more efficient and the results easier to visualize.

### Applying PCA before K-means

1. **Apply PCA**: Reduce the dimensions of the dataset.
2. **Apply K-means Clustering**: Perform clustering on the reduced dataset.
3. **Visualize the Clusters**: Plot the clusters in the reduced feature space.

## Conclusion

K-means clustering is a powerful and versatile algorithm for partitioning data into distinct clusters. It is widely used in various applications, from customer segmentation to image compression and anomaly detection. Combining K-means with PCA can further enhance its performance and interpretability by reducing the dimensionality of the data.
